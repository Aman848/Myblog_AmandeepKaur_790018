      <h1>Niagara Falls:Place,I recentely travelled</h1>
      <img src="mypic.jpg" alt="Pineapple" ><p>
        I love to travel and am also nature loving person. It is my dream to travel all the beautiful and famous places in the world atleast once in my life.When i was in India, I travelled many places there like,Golden Temple, which is very close to my heart and shimla etc.Last year in November, I came to Canada for my studies. Now that I live closer to Toronto, Niagara Falls is still a relatively short distance away. I’ve always felt very blessed to live near such an awesome natural phenomenon place.Last weekand, i travelled there with my friends by car and this was the first place i visited after coming to Canada.
        Niagara Falls is a seasonal destination, but not in the way that you think. You can experience Niagara Falls in all seasons; the best way to see Niagara Falls will vary by the seasons. For instance, most attractions tend to open from the Victoria Day long weekend (May 24th long weekend) until Canadian Thanksgiving (the second weekend of October).
         But, even though some attractions close for the winter, that doesn’t mean that you won’t get the full Niagara Falls experience.Niagara Falls is the collective, name of three big waterfalls on the Niagara River in eastern North America, on the border between the United States and Canada. The three waterfalls are: the Horseshoe Falls, sometimes called the Canadian Falls, the American Falls, and the smaller Bridal Veil Falls. The American Falls and the Horseshoe Falls are separated with Goat Island, and the Bridal Veil Falls separated from the other waterfalls with Luna island Niagara falls is very well known for both its beauty and hydroelectric power.It is Balancing recreational, commercial, and industrial uses and has been a challenge for the stewards of the falls since the 19th century.</p>
